Building Better Scientific Software in Python
=============================================

|

This website provides a tutorial on building better scientific software in Python. It was
developed over time, by multiple people, and has been delivered in multiple formats and venues.

About
-----

Scientists and researchers are increasingly put in the position of also being software developers.
Writing code in the pursuit of science and data analysis brings with it the challenge of making
that code deployable and accessible to collaborators. Novice programmers often find themselves
writing difficult to maintain, difficult to manage code that their peers and collaborators have
trouble using.

The goal of this tutorial is to expose researchers to several best practices in scientific
software engineering that may otherwise take several years to become acquainted with. Though the
implementation of these lessons is Python-specific, the essential ideas can be exported to other
languages or platforms.

The code for this website and the final resulting *package* are available on `GitHub
<https://github.com/glentner/python201>`_. Feedback is welcome in the form of *Issues* or
*Pull Requests*.

Tutorial
--------

The content presented in the :ref:`Tutorial <tutorial>` can stand on its own as a reference. It
can also be delivered as a hands-on workshop by a qualified instructor, with the materials
presented alongside a live demonstration. A simple example bit of code is used to interactively
build up a full featured Python package, complete with documentation and automated testing.

The following topics do not complete an exhaustive set of what could be included; however, they
cover some of the most import elements of good scientific software.

- :ref:`Packaging <packaging>`
- :ref:`Testing <testing>`
- :ref:`Documentation <documentation>`
- :ref:`Command-line Interfaces <commandline_interfaces>`
- :ref:`Logging <logging>`
- :ref:`Performance <performance>`

Getting Started
---------------

Proceed to the :ref:`setup <setup>` page to read about the prerequisites for this tutorial. The
content itself is in the :ref:`Tutorial <tutorial>` section. If you can write a loop and a
function in Python, and if you know how to run a ``.py`` script, you should be able to follow this
tutorial.
